# mix-blend-mode-notes
My very elarly work. Not mutch to see really, but perhaps someone may get something out of this. One may see how mix-blend-mode is applied to elements in isolation and without by moving color chooser sliders. Some theroy and links to even more theory. As a begginer I was porud of how color chooser may be moved around the page.
